# Ruby Scripts

## Info

This folder contains the ruby scripts that will be used to automate the tools in the 'tools' folder.

If you don't want a specific tool to run, simply move the script from here into the 'Do_Not_Run' folder.
Move the script back to this folder when you want it to run again.

Note: AKA will attempt to run all '.rb' Ruby scripts in this folder.  Each script is passed three argument, whether or not they are used.
